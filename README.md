# SnowScrape_ETL
---

## Project Title: **SnowScrape_ETL**

### Description
**WebScrape2Snowflake** is a Python-based ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline designed for extracting data from websites, transforming it according to specific business or analytical needs, and storing it in a Snowflake data warehouse. This project leverages powerful Python libraries such as Beautiful Soup for web scraping, Pandas and NumPy for data transformation, and the Snowflake connector for seamless data integration.

### Key Features
- **Data Extraction:** Uses Beautiful Soup to scrape structured and semi-structured data from websites.
- **Data Transformation:** Utilizes Pandas and NumPy for cleaning, transforming, and preprocessing data to prepare it for analysis.
- **Data Loading:** Converts the transformed data into CSV format and loads it into a Snowflake data warehouse for scalable storage and querying.
- **Modular ETL Design:** The pipeline is modular, making it easy to adapt to different data sources and formats.

### Installation
To run this project, you will need Python and the following libraries:
- `beautifulsoup4`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `snowflake-connector-python`

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4 pandas numpy snowflake-connector-python
```

### Usage
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/WebScrape2Snowflake.git
   cd WebScrape2Snowflake
   ```

2. **Configure Snowflake Connection:**
   Update the Snowflake connection details in the `config.py` file:
   ```python
   SNOWFLAKE_USER = 'your_user'
   SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD = 'your_password'
   SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT = 'your_account'
   ```

3. **Run the ETL Pipeline:**
   Execute the `etl_pipeline.py` script to start the ETL process:
   ```bash
   python etl_pipeline.py
   ```

### Project Structure
- `etl_pipeline.py`: The main script to run the ETL pipeline.
- `extractor.py`: Contains functions for data extraction using Beautiful Soup.
- `transformer.py`: Includes functions for data transformation and cleaning using Pandas and NumPy.
- `loader.py`: Handles the loading of data into Snowflake.
- `config.py`: Stores configuration settings for Snowflake connection.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all Python dependencies required for the project.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
